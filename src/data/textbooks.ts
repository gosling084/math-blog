(b) What are the points at which the latus rectum intersect with the parabola? What is the derivative of the function at those two points?`,
                  solution: `(a) The parabola described by the Cartesian equation $y^2 = 4cx$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, thus the chord of length $8|c|$ drawn perpendicular to the $x$ axis can be described as two chords of length $4|c|$ drawn from the $x$-axis to the points $P = (4c, 4c)$ and $Q = (4c, -4c)$. Taking the dot product of these two points (that, is, vectors from $O$ to $P$ and $Q$, respectively), we get $0$. Thus, the two vectors are perpendicular. $\\blacksquare$

(b) First, we note that the Cartesian equation $y^2 = 4cx$ describes a parabola with focus $F = (c, 0)$ and vertex at $O$, thus putting the directrix line at $x = -c$, making the axis of the parabola the $x$ axis. 

Then, we find the points on the parabola where $x = c$, giving us $(c, 2c)$ and $(c, -2c)$. This means that the length of the latus rectum is $4c$. But we know that the distance from $(c, 0)$ to $(-c, 0)$ is $2c$, thus the latus rectum has length of twice the distance from the focus to the directrix. To find the slope of the lines tangent to the parabola at $(c, 2c)$ and $(c, -2c)$, we take the derivative with respect to $y$: $$\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{y^2}{4c}\\right) = \\frac{y}{2c}$$Evaluating this at $y=2c$ and $y=-2c$, we get slopes $1$ and $-1$, respectively, meaning that the line tangent to the parabola at $(c, 2c)$ has equation $x = y + b$. Evaluating the line at $(c, 2c),$ we find that $b$, the $x$-intercept, is $-c$, meaning that the line intercepts the $x$ axis through the directrix line. Doing this at $(c, -2c)$ gives a tangent line with equation $x = b - y$, evaluating at $(c, -2c)$ gives $b = -c$, meaning that this tangent line also intercepts the $x$ axis through the directrix line. This completes the proof.`,

Differentiating the unit tangent with respect to $t$ gives us:

Whose norm is:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\|T'(t)\\| &= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1+t^2}.

(b) Acceleration can be written component-wise as:
$$

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(t) &= v'(t)\\,T(t) + v(t)\\,T'(t)

Differentiating speed $v(t)$ gives us:
$$

Evaluating $v(t)$ $v'(t)$ and $\\|T(t)\\|$ at $t = \\pi/4$
$$

In the trivial case where $v(t) =0$ for all $t$, then there is no motion. If acceleration is zero for all $t$ with nonzero speed, then $T'(t)$ must be zero for all $t.$ And since $T'(t)$ is the measure of change in direction of $T(t)$, this means that there is no change in direction at any time $t$, thus the motion must be linear.

                  solution: `Recall that by Lagrange's identity for the norm of a cross product,

$$
\\|\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 - \\left(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}\\right)^2
$$
Dividing both sides by $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2$ and taking the square root, we get:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|} &= \\left(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2} \\\\

$$
Where $T$ is the unit tangent $\\mathbf{v}/\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|$

Thus, we wish to show that the normal component of the acceleration vector is equal to  
$$
\\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}
$$
First, we recall that component-wise, acceleration is defined as
$$
\\mathbf{a}(t) = v'(t)T(t) + v(t)\\|T'(t)\\|N(t)
$$
where $N(t) = T'(t)/\\|T'(t)\\|$ is the principal normal vector.

The normal component of the acceleration vector (ie, the coefficient of the principal normal) is:
$$
\\begin{align*}
v\\|T'\\| &= v\\left\\Vert\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{v}\\right)'\\right\\Vert\\\\
&= v\\left\\Vert\\frac{\\mathbf{v}'}{v} - \\frac{v'}{v^2}\\mathbf{v}\\right\\Vert\\\\
&= \\|\\mathbf{a} - v'T\\|
\\end{align*}
$$
But we know by definition that $T$ and $N$ are perpendicular. If we take the dot product $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T,$ noting that $T$ has a length of 1, we get:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T &= v'(T \\cdot T) + v(N \\cdot T)\\\\
&= v'
\\end{align*}
$$
This means that we can rewrite $\\|\\mathbf{a} - v'T\\|$ as:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\|\\mathbf{a} - v'T\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a} - (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T) T\\|
\\end{align*}
$$
Now, we expand the right-hand side of the above equation, recalling that $T \\cdot T = 1,$ to give us:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\|\\mathbf{a} - (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T) T\\| &= \\left(\\left(\\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)T\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)T\\right)\\right)^{1/2} \\\\
&= \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} - 2\\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2 + \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2 (T \\cdot T)\\right)^{1/2} \\\\
&= \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}

Thus, we have proven that 

$$
v\\|T'\\| = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}

(y - 0) = m[x - (x - 2)] \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (y - 0) = m[x - (x + 2)]
\\end{align*}
$$
Plugging in our value for $m$ and simplifying terms, we get

$$
\\begin{align*}
y = 2\\frac{dx}{dy} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -2\\frac{dx}{dy}
\\end{align*}
$$
As we can see, these are both separable differential equations. Separating terms and integrating, we get:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\frac{1}{2}\\int y\\,dy &= \\int dx \\quad \\text{or} \\quad -\\frac{1}{2}\\int y\\,dy = \\int dx\\\\
\\end{align*}
$$
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\frac{y^2}{4} - x = C_0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{y^2}{4} + x = C_1
\\end{align*}
$$
Plugging in our initial value $(x, y) = (1, 2)$, we find that $C_0 = 0$ and $C_1 = 2$, giving us the two Cartesian equations:

$$
y^2 = 4x \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y^2 + 4x = 8

(a) Prove that the acceleration $\\mathbf{a}(t)$ is orthogonal to $A$.
(b) Prove that the speed is constant and compute this speed in terms of $A$, $B$, and $\\theta$.
(c) Make a sketch of the curve, showing its relation to the vectors $A$ and $B.$`,
                  hint: `(a) What is the derivative of $\\mathbf{r}'(t)?$ What do we know about the dot product of a cross product with its components $(\\text{ie},$ what is $A \\cdot (A \\times B))?$

(b) Use the result of part (a) using the velocity vector $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$ with the component definition of acceleration:

$$
\\mathbf{a}(t) = v'(t)T(t) + v(t)T'(t)
$$
recalling that $T(t) = \\mathbf{v}(t)/v(t).$`,
                  solution: `(a) We know that the derivative of the cross product of two vectors $F,$ $G$ is:

$$
(F \\times G)' = F' \\times G + F \\times G'
$$
Applying this to $\\mathbf{r}'(t) = A \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)$, noting that $A$ is a constant vector, we get

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\mathbf{a}(t) &= A' \\times \\mathbf{r}(t) + A \\times \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\\\
&= A \\times \\mathbf{r}'(t)
\\end{align*}
$$
But we know from Theorem 13.12 that the cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to those same two vectors, thus $A$ and $\\mathbf{a}(t)$ are orthogonal for all $t.$

(b) From part (a), we know that $\\mathbf{a}(t) = A \\times \\mathbf{r}'(t)$. Now, we write $\\mathbf{a}(t)$ as the linear combination of its components:

$$
\\mathbf{a}(t) = r''(t)T(t) + r'(t)T'(t)
$$
where $r'(t) = \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$ is the speed and $r''(t) = (r'(t))'$ is the derivative of the speed.

Using the result of part (a), we know that $\\mathbf{a}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) = 0.$ Applying this to the above equation for acceleration, we get:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\mathbf{a}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) &= r''(t)T(t)\\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) + r'(t)T'(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\\\
&= 0
\\end{align*}
$$
But we know that the unit tangent $T(t) = \\mathbf{r}'(t)/\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$, and that $T'(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) = 0$ since the principal normal is orthogonal to any scalar multiple of the unit tangent vector. As such, the above dot product simplifies to:

$$
r''(t)r'(t) = 0
$$
for all $t$. Then, two possible cases arise.

(1) $r'(t) = 0$ for all $t$, in which case position is constant, with $A$ and $B$ being linearly dependent.
(2) $r'(t) \\neq 0 $ for all $t$, in which case $r''(t) = 0$, implying that speed is constant for all $t,$ with 
$$
\\begin{align*}
r'(t) &= \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| \\\\
&= \\|A \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)\\| \\\\
&= \\|A\\|\\|\\mathbf{r}(t)\\|\\sin \\theta_t \\\\
&= k
\\end{align*}
$$
where $\\theta_t$ is the angle between $A$ and $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ at time $t,$ and where $k$ is some real constant. But if $r'(t)$ is constant for all $t,$ then for any given $t$, $r'(t) = r'(0),$ or 
$$
r'(t) = \\|A\\|\\|B\\|\\sin \\theta
$$ 
for all $t.$

Suppose a curve $C$ is described by two equivalent functions $X$ and $Y$, where $Y(t) = X[u(t)]$. Denote the unit tangent for $X$ by $T_X$ and that for $Y$ by $T_Y$.

(a) Prove that at each point of $C$ we have $T_Y(t) = T_X[u(t)]$ if $u$ is strictly increasing, but that $T_Y(t) = -T_X[u(t)]$ if $u$ is strictly decreasing. In the first case, $u$ is said to preserve orientation; in the second case, $u$ is said to reverse orientation.

(b) Prove that the corresponding principal normal vectors $N_X$ and $N_Y$ satisfy $N_Y(t) = N_X[u(t)]$ at each point of $C$. Deduce that the osculating plane is invariant under a change of parameter.`,
                  hint: ``,
                  solution: `(a) We have 
$$
T_X(u) = \\frac{X'(u)}{\\|X'(u)\\|} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T_Y(t) = \\frac{u'(t)}{\|u'(t)\|}\\frac{X'[u(t)]}{\\|X'[u(t)]\\|}
$$
so it follows that if $u$ is strictly increasing, then $u'(t)/\|u'(t)\| = 1$ and $T_Y(t) = T_X[u(t)]$ and if $u$ is strictly decreasing, then $u'(t)/\|u'(t)\| = -1$ and $T_Y(t) = -T_X[u(t)]$

(b) Taking the derivative of $T_X$ with respect to $u$, we get:

$$
\\frac{d}{du}T_X(u) = T'_X(u)
$$
and the principal normal $N_X$ is
$$
N_X = \\frac{T'_X(u)}{\\|T'_X(u)\\|}
$$
Taking the derivative of $T_Y$ with respect to $t$, we get:

$$
\\frac{d}{dt} T_Y = u'(t)\\frac{u'(t)}{\|u'(t)\|}T'_X[u(t)]
$$
And thus the principal normal $N_Y$ is
$$
\\begin{align*}
N_Y &= \\frac{u'(t)^2}{u'(t)^2} \\frac{T'_X[u(t)]}{\\|T'_X[u(t)]\\|} \\\\
&= \\frac{T'_X[u(t)]}{\\|T'_X[u(t)]\\|}\\\\
&= N_X
\\end{align*} 
$$
This demonstrates that the osculating plane is invariant under a change of parameter because the linear span of $T_X$ and $N_X$ is the same as that of $T_Y$ and $N_Y.$ Moreover, the cross products $T_X \\times N_X$ and $T_Y \\times N_Y$ only differ (potentially) by sign.

$$
s = 4a\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\sqrt{1 - k^2\\sin^2t}\\,dt

To find how long it takes for the particle to move 12 units of distance from the initial position $\\mathbf{r}(0)$, we find $t_0$ such that the arc length traced out by $t_0$ has length $12.$ In other words, we wish to find $t_0$ such that:

$$x = a(\\theta - \\sin \\theta), \\quad y = a(1 - \\cos \\theta)$$
let us first consider the position of the point as the circle rotates in place. The circle has a radius of length $a$ centered at $(0, a).$ As the circle rotates clockwise, the angle $\\theta$ swept out by the radius can be described as the angle between $A = (0, -a)$ and $B = (-x, -a + y),$ whose cosine is defined as:
$$
\\cos\\theta = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\|\\|B\\|}
$$
But $A$ and $B$ are both points on the circle, so their norms are both $a$, giving us:

$$
\\cos\\theta = \\frac{a^2 - ay}{a^2}
$$
In other words, we can parameterize $y$ as a function of $\\theta:$

$$
y = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)
$$
To express $x$ as a function of $\\theta$, we note once again that $B$ is a point on the circle with radius $a$. Substituting the above equation for $y$, we get
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\|B\\|^2 &= a^2
\\\\
&= x^2 + \\left[-a + (a - a\\cos\\theta)\\right]^2
\\\\
&= x^2 + a^2\\cos^2\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
Which means that $x^2 = a^2(1 - \\cos^2\\theta) = \\sin^2\\theta$ or that $\|x\| = a\\sin\\theta.$ But we know from before that $B = (-x, y - a),$ which implies that $a\\sin\\theta = -x,$ hence

$$x = -a\\sin\\theta$$
Now, suppose the circle rolls along the positive $x$-axis. This simply means that the circle's horizontal position is displaced by $a\\theta$ units of length as it rotates $\\theta$ radians. Thus, our $x$-component is displaced by $a\\theta,$ which gives us the parametric equations for position:

$$x = a(\\theta - \\sin \\theta), \\quad y = a(1 - \\cos \\theta)$$
as requested. $\\blacksquare$


(b) To show that $dy/dx = \\cot(\\theta/2)$, we first take the derivative of our positional components with respect to $\\theta$:

$$
\\frac{dx}{d\\theta} = a(1 - \\cos\\theta), \\quad \\frac{dy}{d\\theta} = a\\sin\\theta
$$
Then, we use the double-angle identities for sine and cosine:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin\\theta = 2\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}
\\end{align*}
$$
giving us:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{dx}{d\\theta} = 2a\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2}; \\quad \\frac{dy}{d\\theta} = 2a\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}
\\end{align*}
$$
Then, we see that
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\frac{dy}{dx} &= \\frac{2a\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}}{2a\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2}}
\\\\
&= \\cot\\frac{1}{2}\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
(valid for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$)

Now, we note that $\\cot(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta) = \\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2})$, which means the tangent line is parallel to the unit vector $\\mathbf{u}$ defined by:

$$
\\mathbf{u} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\mathbf{i} +  \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\mathbf{j}
$$
The angle $\\phi$ between $\\mathbf{u}$ and the $x$-axis satisfies:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\cos\\phi = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{i}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\|\\mathbf{i}\\|}
=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)
\\end{align*}
$$
where $0 \\leq \\phi \\leq \\pi$ 

But this implies that the line tangent to the cycloid at $(x, y)$ makes an angle of $(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2})$ with the $x$-axis. $\\blacksquare$

$$
\\cos \\phi = \\frac{A \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t)}{\\|A\\|\\|\\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}
$$ 
But we know that $\\mathbf{v}(t) = A \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)$, which means that $A \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) = 0$ and thus $\\cos \\phi = 0.$ But since $0 < \\phi < \\pi$ it must be the case that $\\phi = \\pi/2$ and $\\sin \\phi = 1.$ Plugging this back into our equation for the norm of $T'(t)$ we see that

$$
X \\cdot N = 0

Then, use the result to show that the curve describes an ellipse inside the given plane.

Theorem 14.14 allows us to express curvature in terms of the cross product of acceleration and velocity:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\kappa(t) &= \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}{v^3(t)}
\\end{align*}
$$
Which in turn means that the radius of curvature is:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\rho(t) &= \\frac{v^3(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}

                  solution: `(a) To find the Cartesian equation for the plane containing this curve, we first find the normal vector $N = (a, b, c)$ such that for any given point $X = (x, y, z)$ in the plane: 
$$
\\begin{align*}

X \\cdot N = 0

$$
In other words, we wish to find scalars $a, b, c$ (not all zero) such that
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
4a \\cos t + 4b \\sin t + 4c \\cos t &= 0
\\end{align*}
$$
for all $t.$ This relation can be satisfied for all $t$ by the normal vector $N = (1, 0, -1)$ which gives us the following Cartesian equation for the plane containing the curve:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
x = z
\\end{align*}
$$
Now, if we perform the substitution $u = x + z$ we can see that 
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
u^2 + y^2 &= x^2 + 2xz + z^2 + y^2
\\\\
\\end{align*}
$$
But, we know from our previous result that the curve described by $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ lies in the plane $x = z.$ Thus, we can express the three-dimensional curve $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ as a two-dimensional curve lying in the plane $x = z$ and rewrite the above equation as:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
u^2 + y^2 &= 4x^2 + y^2
\\\\
&= 64\\cos^2 t + 16 \\sin^2 t
\\end{align*}
$$
But, if we set $a = 8$ and $b = 4,$ we can see that this curve is an ellipse with Cartesian equation
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{u^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} &= 1
\\quad

(b) To find the radius of curvature of $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ we must first find its velocity:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{v}(t) &= -4\\sin t\\,\\mathbf{i} + 4\\cos t\\,\\mathbf{j} + -4\\sin t\\,\\mathbf{k}
\\end{align*}
$$
Its speed
$$
\\begin{align*}
v(t) &= 4\\sqrt{1 + \\sin^2 t}
\\end{align*}
$$
And its acceleration:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(t) &= -4\\cos t\\,\\mathbf{i} -4\\sin t\\,\\mathbf{j} -4\\cos t\\,\\mathbf{k}
\\end{align*}
$$
From Theorem 14.14, we know that curvature $\\kappa(t)$ can be written as:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\kappa(t) &= \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}{v^3(t)}
\\end{align*}
$$
And thus the radius of curvature $\\rho(t)$ can be written as:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\rho(t) &= \\frac{v^3(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}
\\end{align*}
$$
By Lagrange's identity on the norm of a cross product, we know that
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|^2 &= \\|\\mathbf{a}(t)\\|^2\\|\\mathbf{v}(t)\\|^2 - \\left(\\mathbf{a}(t)\\cdot\\mathbf{v}(t)\\right)^2

&= 512
\\end{align*}
$$
Thus, $\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\| = 16\\sqrt{2}$ which makes the radius of curvature:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\rho(t) &= \\frac{v^3(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}
\\\\

\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{r}(x) &= x\\,\\mathbf{i} + cx^2\\,\\mathbf{j}
\\end{align*}
$$
where $c$ is a real-valued scalar constant. Now, we find its velocity, speed, and acceleration with respect to $x$
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{v}(x) &= \\mathbf{i} + 2cx\\,\\mathbf{j}
\\\\
\\\\
v(x) &= \\sqrt{1 + 4c^2x^2}
\\\\
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(x) &= 2c\\,\\mathbf{j}
\\end{align*}
$$
To find the radius of curvature, we first use Equation (14.22) to calculate curvature
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\kappa(x) &= \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{a}(x) \\times \\mathbf{v}(x)\\|}{v^3(x)} \\tag{14.22}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\|-2c\\,\\mathbf{k}\\|}{\\left(1 + 4c^2x^2\\right)^{3/2}}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\|2c\|}{\\left(1 + 4c^2x^2\\right)^{3/2}}
\\end{align*}
$$
If $c \\neq 0,$ we can take reciprocal of $\\kappa(x)$ to give:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\rho(x) &= \\frac{\\left(1 + 4c^2x^2\\right)^{3/2}}{\|2c\|}
\\end{align*}
$$
But, since $4c^2x^2$ must be greater than or equal to zero for all real $x$ and $c,$ then $\\rho(x)$ is smallest at $x = 0.$ But when $x = 0,$ $y = cx^2 = 0,$ which is the vertex of the parabola described by $\\mathbf{r}(x). \\quad \\blacksquare$

(b) Using the result of (a), we know that the vertex of a given parabola is the point at which the radius of curvature is smallest. Thus, we wish to find $t$ that minimizes $\\rho(t).$ First, we find velocity, speed, and acceleration with respect to $t$
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{v}(t) &= A + 2tB
\\\\
\\\\
v(t) &= \\|A + 2tB\\|
\\\\
&= \\left[(A \\cdot A) + 4t(A\\cdot B\\right) + 4t^2(B\\cdot B)]^{1/2}
\\\\
&= \\left[1 + 4t\\cos\\theta+ 4t^2\\right]^{1/2}
\\\\
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(t) &= 2B
\\end{align*}
$$
Then, we can use Equation (14.22) to obtain
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\kappa(t) &= \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}{v^3(t)} \\tag{14.22}
\\end{align*}
$$
Calculating the cross product of acceleration and velocity, noting that $B \\times B = O$
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t) &= 2B \\times \\left(A + 2tB\\right)
\\\\
&= 2B \\times A
\\end{align*}
$$
Taking the norm of this product, noting that $A$ and $B$ are unit vectors, we get:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\| &= 2\\|B \\times A\\|
\\\\
&= 2\\|B\\|\\|A\\|\\sin\\theta
\\\\
&=2\\sin\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
Combining this with our previously calculated speed, we can express the radius of curvature as the reciprocal of $\\kappa(t)$
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\rho(t) &= \\frac{v^3(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{a}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\left[1 + 4t\\cos\\theta + 4t^2\\right]^{3/2}}{2\\sin\\theta}
\\end{align*}
$$
To find an extremum of $\\rho$, we take its derivative with respect to $t$
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\rho'(t) &= \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\left[1 + 4t\\cos\\theta + 4t^2\\right]^{1/2}}{2\\sin\\theta}\\left(4\\cos\\theta+8t\\right)
\\end{align*}
$$
Setting $\\rho' = 0$ and solving for $t$ we see that the radius of curvature has exactly one extremum at $t = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta.$ 

We can see that $\\rho$ is decreasing when $t < -\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta$ and increasing when $t > -\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta$ which must mean that this extremum is a local minimum. And since it is the only extremum, it is also the global minimum. 

But we know from part (a) that the smallest radius of curvature for a parabola occurs at its vertex. Thus, the vertex of the parabola described by $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ occurs at
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta A + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos^2\\theta B
\\quad
\\blacksquare
\\end{align*}

Using the chain rule, noting that $v(t) = ds/dt$, we can deduce that

Given that the velocity has a starting angle of $\\pi/2$ and that the particle never crosses the $y$-axis, this implies that the angle of inclination always moves towards $0.$ In other words, $\\alpha'(t) = -\\kappa(t)v(t).$

Plugging in our values for speed and curvature, and noting that the starting angle is $\\pi/2,$ we can express the angle of inclination explicitly as a function of $t$ by integrating its derivative from $0$ to $t$

Using the chain rule, we can write $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{dt}$ as:

Then, radial position is defined by $\\mathbf{r} = r\\mathbf{u}_r.$ Using equations (14.25) and (14.26), we can express velocity and acceleration in terms of their radial and transverse components as follows:

The curvature of the curve described by $\\mathbf{r}$ can be obtained by using equation (14.22):
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\kappa(t) &= \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{v}\\|}{v^3(t)}

Using Lagrange's identity, noting that $\\mathbf{u}_r$ and $\\mathbf{u}_\\theta$ are perpendicular unit vectors, we obtain

\\\\
&= \\sqrt{r^4 + 4r^2 + 4}
\\\\

In the above derivation, we also see that $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = r^2 + 1.$ Combining these results, we find that curvature is:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\kappa &= \\frac{r^2 + 2}{\\left(r^2 + 1\\right)^{3/2}}

(b) We first wish to show that $G = \\left\\{c\\mathbf{r}(t)\\ \|\\ c\\ \\text{real}\\right\\}$ is the generator line of the conical helix for all $t.$ It will suffice to show that for some fixed line $A,$ $G$ intersects $A$ at point $P$ making a constant angle with $A$ for all $t.$ Let $A = \\left\\{s\\mathbf{k}\\ \|\\ s\\ \\text{real}\\right\\}$ and let $P = O.$ We know that when $t = 0$ that $\\mathbf{r}(t) = O$ which means that $G$ intersects $A$ at the origin. 

To show that $G$ makes a constant angle with $A$ for all $t$, we find the cosine of the angle $\\phi$ between the two lines:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{\\mathbf{r}(t)\\cdot\\mathbf{k}}{\\|\\mathbf{r}(t)\\|\\|\\mathbf{k}\\|}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{z(t)}{t\\sqrt{\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t + 1}}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{t}{t\\sqrt{2}}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}
\\end{align*}
$$
for all $t.$ And since the cosine of $\\phi$ is constant for all $t,$ with $0 < \\phi < \\pi/2,$ it implies that the angle $\\phi$ must also be constant. Thus, we have shown that the line $G$ through the origin parallel to $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is the generator of the right circular cone containing the conical helix described by $\\mathbf{r}(t).$

Now, to find a formula for the angle $\\alpha$ between the generator line $G$ and the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ at a given $t,$ we first note that since $G$ is a scalar multiple of $\\mathbf{r}(t),$ the cosine of the angle between $G$ and $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the same as that between $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{v}(t).$ Then, we take the dot product of the position and velocity vectors at $t:$
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\cos\\alpha &= \\frac{\\mathbf{r}(t)\\cdot\\mathbf{v}(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{r}(t)\\|\\|\\mathbf{v}(t)\\|}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{r(t) + z(t)}{\\sqrt{2}\\,t\\left(\\sqrt{t^2 + 2}\\right)}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{2t}{\\sqrt{2}\\,t\\left(\\sqrt{t^2 + 2}\\right)}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{t^2 + 2}}
\\end{align*}
$$
where $0 < \\alpha < \\pi/2.$ Taking the inverse cosine, we get:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\alpha &= \\arccos\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{t^2 + 2}}
\\quad
\\blacksquare

Setting $a = 0$ and $b = \\pi,$ using the double-angle identities for the sine and cosine 
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\sin 2\\theta &= 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
\\cos 2\\theta &= 1 - 2\\sin^2\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
we get:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
a(R) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^\\pi \\sin^4\\theta\\,d\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{1}{8}\\int_0^\\pi (1 - \\cos 2\\theta)^2\\,d\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\pi}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\\int_0^\\pi \\cos^2 2\\theta - 2\\cos 2\\theta\\,d\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\pi}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\\int_0^\\pi \\cos^2 2\\theta\\,d\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
Integration by parts with
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
u &= \\cos2\\theta, \\quad dv = \\cos2\\theta
\\\\
v &= \\frac{1}{2}\\sin2\\theta, \\quad du = -2\\sin2\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
gives us:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\int_0^\\pi \\cos^2 2\\theta\\,d\\theta &= \\frac{1}{2}\\sin2\\theta\\cos2\\theta\\,\\Biggr\|_0^{\\pi} + \\int_0^{\\pi}\\sin^2 2\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{\\pi}(1 - \\cos4\\theta)\\,d\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}\\sin4\\theta\\,\\Biggr\|_0^{\\pi}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\pi}{2}.
\\end{align*}
$$
Plugging this back into our previous equation for $a(R)$ gives us:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
a(R) &= \\frac{\\pi}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\\int_0^\\pi \\cos^2 2\\theta\\,d\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\pi}{8} + \\frac{\\pi}{16}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{3\\pi}{16}
\\quad
\\blacksquare
\\end{align*}
$$
(b) We know from Exercise 4 that the arc length $s$ of the curve given by the polar equation $r = f(\\theta)$ from $\\theta = a$ to $\\theta = b,$ where $a \\leq \\theta \\leq b \\leq a + 2\\pi$ is:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
s &= \\int_a^b \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\right)^2}\\,d\\theta.
\\end{align*}
$$
Evaluating for $r = \\sin^2\\theta$ over the interval $[0, \\pi]$ we get:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
s &= \\int_0^\\pi \\sqrt{\\sin^4\\theta + \\left(2\\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta\\right)^2}\\,d\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\sqrt{\\sin^2\\theta + 4\\cos^2\\theta}\\,d\\theta
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\sqrt{1 + 3\\cos^2\\theta}\\,d\\theta.
\\end{align*}
$$
Using the substitution $u = -\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\theta$ and $du = \\sqrt{3}\\sin\\theta$, noting that cosine is an even function $($ie, the integral from -$\\sqrt{3}$ to $0$ is equal to that from $0$ to $\\sqrt{3})$ the above becomes:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
s &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{-\\sqrt{3}}^{\\sqrt{3}} \\sqrt{u^2 + 1}\\,du
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{3}} \\sqrt{u^2 + 1}\\,du.
\\end{align*}
$$
Now, recall from Section 6.25 that integrals of the form
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\int R\\left(x, \\sqrt{a^2 + (cx + d)^2}\\right)\\,dx
\\end{align*}
$$
can be handled using the substitution $cx + d = a\\tan t$ and $dx = a\\sec^2 t\\,dt.$ Accordingly, we perform the substitution $u = \\tan t$ and $du = \\sec^2 t\\,dt$ to give us:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
s &= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec^2 t\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 t}\\,dt
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec^3 t\\,dt.
\\end{align*}
$$
Using integration by parts, with
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
x &= \\sec t, \\quad dy = \\sec^2 t\\,dt
\\\\
y &= \\tan t, \\quad dx = \\tan t \\sec t\\,dt 
\\end{align*}
$$
the integral becomes:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec^3 t\\,dt &= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sec t \\tan t\\,\\Biggr\|_{0}^{\\pi/3} -  \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\tan^2 t \\sec t\\,dt
\\\\
\\\\
&= 4 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec^3 t -  \\sec t\\,dt.
\\end{align*}
$$
Then, noting that we have the integral term $\\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec^3 t\\,dt$ on both sides, we can rearrange the above to get
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec^3 t\\,dt &= 2 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec t\\,dt.
\\end{align*}
$$
Recall from Section 14.13, Exercise 8 that $\\int \\sec t\\,dt = \\log(\\sec t + \\tan t) + C.$ As such, we obtain
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
s &= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} \\sec^3 t\\,dt 
\\\\
\\\\
&= 2 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\log(\\sec t + \\tan t )\\,\\Biggr\|_0^{\\pi/3}
\\\\
\\\\
&= 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{3}\\log(2 + \\sqrt{3})
\\quad
\\blacksquare
\\end{align*}

y' &= \\frac{r'\\sin\\theta + r\\cos\\theta}{r'\\cos\\theta - r\\sin\\theta}
\\end{align*}
Setting $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta,$ the given equation for $y'$ becomes:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
y' &= \\frac{y - x}{y + x}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{r\\sin\\theta - r \\cos\\theta}{r \\sin\\theta + r \\cos\\theta}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta}
\\end{align*}
Now, we can plug this into our separable equation in $r:$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{r'}{r} &= \\frac{\\frac{\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta}\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta}{\\frac{\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta}\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{\\left(\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta\\right)\\sin\\theta + \\left(\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta\\right)\\cos\\theta}{\\left(\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta\\right)\\cos\\theta - \\left(\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta\\right)\\sin\\theta}
\\\\
\\\\
&= -1
\\end{align*}
Integrating both sides, we get $\\log r +\\theta = C.$ But since $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\\theta = \\arctan \\frac{y}{x},$ we reach the conclusion:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\\\
\\log \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \\arctan \\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) &= C
\\quad

\\mathbf{u}_r &= \\cos \\theta\\,\\mathbf{i} + \\sin \\theta\\,\\mathbf{j}

We can use the chain rule to find $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{dt}:$
\\begin{align*}

\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{dt} &= \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{d\\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}

(a) Show that there is a vector $\\pmb{\\omega}(t)$ parallel to the $z$-axis such that

$$
\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)
$$
where $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ denote the position and velocity vectors at times $t.$ The vector $\\pmb{\\omega}(t)$ is called the angular velocity vector and its magnitude $\\omega(t) = \\|\\pmb{\\omega}(t)\\|$ is called the angular speed.

(b) The vector $\\pmb{\\alpha}(t) = \\pmb{\\omega}'(t)$ is called the angular acceleration vector. Show that the acceleration vector $\\mathbf{a}(t) = \\mathbf{v}'(t)$ is given by the formula

(b) Recall that for two vector-valued functions $F$ and $G,$ $\\left(F \\times G\\right)' = \\left(F' \\times G\\right) + \\left(G' \\times F\\right).$

(c) If the motion lies in the $xy$-plane, what does this imply about the term $\\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right]\\pmb{\\omega}(t)$ in the equation for acceleration? If angular velocity $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ is constant, what does this imply about $\\pmb{\\alpha}(t)?$ 
`,
                  solution: `(a) For circular motion with center on the $z$-axis, we have the following relations between the rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ and the polar coordinates $r$ and $\\theta.$ Let $r = \\|\\mathbf{r}\\|,$ then 
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
x &= r\\cos\\theta,
\\quad
y = r\\sin\\theta.
\\end{align*}                  
We now define two perpendicular unit vectors $\\mathbf{u}_r$ and $\\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}:$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{u}_r &= \\cos\\theta\\,\\mathbf{i} + \\sin\\theta\\,\\mathbf{j}

\\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} &= \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{d\\theta}
\\\\
\\\\
&= -\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathbf{i} + \\cos\\theta\\,\\mathbf{j}
\\end{align*}
Then, we can rewrite position as $\\mathbf{r}(t) = r\\mathbf{u}_r.$ As such, the equation for velocity becomes:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{v}(t) &= \\frac{d\\left(r\\mathbf{u}_r\\right)}{dt}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{dr}{dt}\\mathbf{u}_r + r\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{dt}
\\end{align*}
Applying the chain rule, with $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{dt} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_r}{d\\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt},$ we can express velocity as a linear combination of the component vectors $\\mathbf{u}_r$ and $\\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}:$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{v}(t) &= \\frac{dr}{dt}\\mathbf{u}_r + r\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} 
\\end{align*}
where the scalar factors $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ and $r\\frac{d\\theta}{dt},$ respectively, are called the radial and transverse components of velocity.

For a particle moving along a circle, we know that the radius remains constant, thus the radial component of velocity is zero. Rewriting $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ in terms of the component vectors $\\mathbf{i}$ and $\\mathbf{j},$ we get:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{v}(t) &= r\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\left(-r\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathbf{i} + r\\cos\\theta\\,\\mathbf{j}\\right)
\\end{align*}
But as we saw in Exercise 18, this linear combination is equal to the cross product $\\omega\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{r},$ where $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}.$ Thus, we have shown that there exists a vector $\\pmb{\\omega}(t)$ parallel to the $z$-axis satisfying $\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)$ for circular motion with center on the $z\\text{-axis.}\\quad \\blacksquare$

(b) Calculating $\\mathbf{a}(t) = \\mathbf{v}'(t),$ we get:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(t) &= \\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right]'
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\left[\\pmb{\\alpha}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right] + \\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\right]

Expanding the rightmost term, we get:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t) &= -\\omega^2r\\cos\\theta\\,\\mathbf{i} - \\omega^2r\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathbf{j}
\\\\
\\\\
&= -\\omega^2\\mathbf{r}(t)
\\end{align*}
where $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ is the angular velocity. Then, we note that $\\pmb{\\omega}(t)$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{k}$ and thus perpendicular to $\\mathbf{r},$ making the term $\\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right]\\pmb{\\omega}(t) = 0.$ As such, the equation for acceleration becomes
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(t) &= \\left[\\pmb{\\alpha}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right] + \\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\times \\mathbf{v}(t)\\right]
\\\\
\\\\
&= -\\omega^2\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\left[\\pmb{\\alpha}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right]
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right]\\pmb{\\omega}(t) -\\omega^2\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\pmb{\\alpha}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)
\\quad
\\blacksquare
\\end{align*}

(c) If the particle lies in the $xy$-plane, then the position vector is perpendicular to the $z$-axis, and thus $\\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right]\\pmb{\\omega}(t) = O.$ Additionally, if the angular velocity $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ is constant for all $t,$ then $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = 0.$ But $\\pmb{\\alpha}(t) = \\pmb{\\omega}'(t) = \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}\\mathbf{k},$ thus $\\pmb{\\alpha}(t) = O,$ making $\\pmb{\\alpha}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t) = O.$ This leaves us with
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\mathbf{a}(t) &= \\left[\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t)\\right]\\pmb{\\omega}(t) -\\omega^2\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\pmb{\\alpha}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)

\\mathbf{v}_p(t) &= \\frac{dr}{dt}\\mathbf{u}_r + r_p\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}
\\end{align*}
where the scalar factors $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ and $r_p\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ are called the radial and transverse components of velocity, respectively.

But since the body is rigid, we know that for any pair of particles $p$ and $q,$ the distance $\\|\\mathbf{r}_p(t) - \\mathbf{r}_q(t)\\|$ is constant for all $t$. Suppose $q$ sits at the origin. Then, every particle $p$ inside the body undergoes circular motion about the origin, which means that the radial component of velocity $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0,$ making $\\mathbf{v}_p(t) = r\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}.$

As we showed in Exercise 19, we can express this velocity as the cross product $\\pmb{\\omega}(t) \\times \\mathbf{r}_p(t),$ where $\\pmb{\\omega}(t) = \\omega(t)\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\omega(t) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}:$

                  solution: `We know that the line tangent to $\\mathbf{r}$ must be parallel to $\\mathbf{r}'$, so we can use the dot and cross products of $\\mathbf{r}$ and $\\mathbf{r}'$ to give us:

Now, suppose $X$ is such that

\\|X - F\\|^2 > e^2d(X, L)^2

Now, if $X$ is such that:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} &< 1

we can use a similar argument to show that $\\|X - F\\| < ed(X, L)$ and hence $X$ lies inside the ellipse $C.$ This completes the proof.

d_2 &= \\frac{\|1 - ex_0/a\|}{\\sqrt{x_0^2/a^4 + y_0^2/b^4}}

Then, using the ellipse equation to give us $y_0^2 = b^2(1 - x_0^2/a^2),$ and noting that $b^2 = a^2(1 - e^2),$ we get:

\\\\
d_1d_2 &= \\frac{\|1 - e^2x_0^2/a^2\|}{x_0^2/a^4 + y_0^2/b^4}

Then, we note that $x_0^2/a^2 + y_0^2/b^2 = 1$ and $e < 1,$ which means that $a^2 > x_0^2,$ and moreover, that $a^2 - e^2x_0^2> 0,$ simplifying the above equation to $d_1d_2 = b^2.$ But from Theorem 13.19 we know that this is the square of half the length of the minor axis. This completes the proof.

                  solution: `First, we define our ellipse and circle in terms of the eccentricity $e$ and the distance $d$ from the focus of the ellipse to the directrix. The ellipse can be described by the standard-form equation

where $a = ed/(1 - e^2)$ and $b^2 = a^2(1 - e^2).$ From Theorem 13.19, we know that its foci are located at $(-ae, 0)$ and $(ae, 0),$ which means that the circle passing through the foci has the standard form equation
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{x^2}{a^2e^2} + \\frac{y^2}{a^2e^2} &= 1
\\end{align*}
Now, to find the points of tangency, we must first find the points at which the slope of the circle and the slope of the ellipse are equal. To do so, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ of the ellipse and circle respectively:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{2x}{a^2} + \\frac{2y}{b^2}\\frac{dy}{dx} &= 0,
\\quad
2x + 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
\\end{align*}
And since the circle passes through the foci of the ellipse located at $(-ae, 0)$ and $(ae, 0),$ we know that the circle cannot be tangent to the ellipse when $y = 0.$ As such, we can express the respective slopes of the ellipse and circle as follows:
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\\frac{b^2x}{a^2y},

\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{y}

Then, setting the two equal, we find that the slope of the circle is parallel to that of the ellipse when $b^2x/a^2 = x,$ or when $e^2x = 0.$ And since we know that $e > 0,$ we can see that the slopes are parallel when $x = 0.$ 

To show tangency, we must also find the eccentricity $e$ such that the two curves intersect when $x = 0.$ In other words, we wish to find $e$ that satisfies $b^2 = a^2e^2,$ or $e^2 = 1 - e^2.$ This is satisfied by

2. If $P$ and $X$ are both points on the line normal to the curve at $X,$ what is the Cartesian equation of the normal line? Parameterize $y$ by $x$ and take its derivative to find the slope of the line tangent to $X.$`,
                  solution: `Let $X = (x, y)$ be a point on the curve, parameterized by $x.$ Its derivative is $X' = (1, \\frac{dy}{dx}).$ The line normal to the curve at $X$ is then parallel to $N = (\\frac{dy}{dx}, -1).$ Now, let $P = (x_0, 0)$ be a point at the intersection of the $x$-axis and normal line such that the line segments $OX$ and $PX$ form an isosceles triangle whose base of length $x_0$ is on the $x$-axis. In other words, we have $\\|P - X\\| = \\|X\\|,$ or
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
(x_0 - x)^2 + y^2 &= x^2 + y^2
\\end{align*}
We can see from this relation that $x_0^2 = 2x_0x.$ Assuming that the triangle has a nonzero base, we can see that $x_0 = 2x.$ To find $y$ in terms of its parameter $x,$ we note that since $X$ and $P$ are both points on the normal line, $(P - X)$ is parallel to $N$ and perpendicular to $X'.$ Thus, the Cartesian equation of the normal line is $(P - X) \\cdot X' = 0$ or:

x - y\\frac{dy}{dx} &= 0

To find the family of curves satisfying this condition, we note that $X$ and $P$ are both points on the line normal to the curve at $P.$ In other words, if $P$ is parameterized by $x,$ then the line segment $(P - X)$ is perpendicular to $P' = (1, \\frac{dy}{dx}).$ That is, $(P - X)\\cdot P' = 0,$ or

Let $P = (x, y)$ be an arbitrary point on the hyperbola. Note that the asymptote lines $y_1 = -bx/\|a\|$ and $y_2 = bx/\|a\|$ pass through the origin. As such, we can express the perpendicular distance from $P$ to the lines given by $y_1$ and $y_2$ as $d_1 = \|P \\cdot N_1\|/\\|N_1\\|$ and $d_2 = \|P \\cdot N_2\|/\\|N_2\\|,$ where

                  hint: `Recall from Section 14.19, Exercise 4 where we proved that for a polar function $r = f(\\theta),$ its arc length from $\\theta = a$ to $\\theta = b,$ where $a \\leq \\theta \\leq b \\leq a + 2\\pi,$ is given by:

                  solution: `(a) For a polar function $r = f(\\theta),$ its arc length from $\\theta = a$ to $\\theta = b,$ where $a \\leq \\theta \\leq b \\leq a + 2\\pi,$ is given by:

Then, if an arbitrary arc joining points $(a, f(a))$ and $(x, f(x))$ is proportional to the angle $x$ distended from the origin, we have
\\begin{align*}
\\int_a^x \\sqrt{f^2(\\theta) + \\left[f'(\\theta)\\right]^2}\\,d\\theta &= kx
\\end{align*}
for some $k > 0.$ Using the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and differentiating with respect to $x,$ we have $k = \\sqrt{f^2(x) + \\left[f'(x)\\right]^2},$ or equivalently, 
\\begin{align*}
k^2 &= f^2(x) + \\left[f'(x)\\right]^2
\\end{align*}
Differentiating once more, we see that $f'(x)\\left[f(x) + f''(x)\\right] = 0.$ This relation is satisfied in two possible ways:

1. $f'(x) = 0.$ In this case, $f(x)$ is constant and the integral for arc length becomes
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\int_a^{\\theta} \\sqrt{f^2(x) + \\left[f'(x)\\right]^2}\\,dx &= \\int_a^{\\theta} f(x)\\,dx

\\\\
\\\\
&= k\\theta
\\end{align*}
where $F'(\\theta) = f(\\theta).$ Then, differentiating $F$ with respect to $\\theta$ gives us $f(\\theta) = k.$

2. $f'(x) \\neq 0.$ In this case, $f''(x) + f(x) = 0.$ But recall from Theorem 8.6 (c) that for $b > 0 $ the the second order equation $y'' + by = 0$ is satisfied uniquely by
\\begin{align*}
y &= c_1\\cos cx + c_2\\sin cx
\\end{align*}
where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants, and $b = c^2.$ But in this case, $b = 1,$ which gives us
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
f(x) &= c_1\\cos x + c_2\\sin x
\\end{align*}
Where $c_1^2 + c_2^2 = k^2.$ Then, setting $c_1 = 0,$ $c_2 = k,$ and $C = 0,$ we can then use the identity $\\sin(x + C) = \\sin x \\cos C + \\cos x \\sin C$ to rewrite $f(x) = k\\sin(x + C).\\, \\blacksquare$

(b) For a polar function $r = f(\\theta),$ its arc length from $\\theta = a$ to $\\theta = b,$ where $a \\leq \\theta \\leq b \\leq a + 2\\pi,$ is given by:
\\begin{align*}
\\int_a^b \\sqrt{f^2(\\theta) + \\left[f'(\\theta)\\right]^2}\\,d\\theta
\\end{align*}
Then, if an arbitrary arc joining points $(a, f(a))$ and $(x, f(x))$ is proportional to the difference of the radial distances from the origin, we have:
\\begin{align*}
\\int_a^x \\sqrt{f^2(\\theta) + \\left[f'(\\theta)\\right]^2}\\,d\\theta &= k\\left[f(x) - f(a)\\right]
\\end{align*}
for some $k > 0.$ Using the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and differentiating with respect to $x,$ we have $\\sqrt{f^2(x) + \\left[f'(x)\\right]^2} = kf'(x),$ or equivalently, 
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
f^2(x) + \\left[f'(x)\\right]^2 &= k^2\\left[f'(x)\\right]^2
\\end{align*}
Differentiating once more and combining terms, we get
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
f'(x)\\left[f(x) + f''(x)\\right] &= f'(x)k^2f''(x)
\\end{align*}
If $f'(x) = 0$ then $f(x)$ is constant for all $x$ and the difference $f(\\theta) - f(a)$ is trivially zero. Suppose then that $f'(x) \\neq 0.$ If $k = 1,$ we have $f(x) = 0.$ Otherwise, we can see that $f(x)$ is a scalar multiple of $f''(x),$ where
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
f''(x) + \\frac{1}{1 - k^2}f(x) &= 0
\\end{align*}
Following the result of Theorem 8.6 for the second order equation $y'' + by = 0,$ we have two cases:

1. $0 < k < 1.$ In this case, $b > 0$ and $y = f(x)$ can be solved for arbitrary constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ as
$$y = c_1\\cos cx + c_2\\sin cx$$ where $c = \\sqrt{1/(1 - k^2)}.$

2. $k > 1.$ In this case, $b < 0$ and $y = f(x)$ can be solved for arbitrary constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ as 
\\begin{align*}
f(x) &= c_1e^{cx} + c_2e^{-cx}
\\end{align*} where $c = \\sqrt{1/(k^2 - 1)}.$ Setting $c_1 = C$ and $c_2 = 0,$ we get
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
f(x) &= Ce^{x/\\sqrt{k^2 - 1}} \\quad \\blacksquare
\\end{align*}
(c) For a polar function $r = f(\\theta),$ its arc length from $\\theta = a$ to $\\theta = b,$ where $a \\leq \\theta \\leq b \\leq a + 2\\pi,$ is given by:
\\begin{align*}
\\int_a^b \\sqrt{f^2(\\theta) + \\left[f'(\\theta)\\right]^2}\\,d\\theta
\\end{align*}
Then, if an arbitrary arc joining points $(a, f(a))$ and $(x, f(x))$ is proportional to the area of the sector formed by the arc and the radii to its endpoints, we have:
\\begin{align*}
\\int_a^x \\sqrt{f^2(\\theta) + \\left[f'(\\theta)\\right]^2}\\,d\\theta &= \\frac{k}{2}\\int_a^x f^2(\\theta)\\,d\\theta
\\end{align*}
for some $k > 0.$ Using the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and differentiating with respect to $x,$ we have $\\sqrt{f^2(x) + \\left[f'(x)\\right]^2} = \\frac{k}{2}f^{2}(x),$ or equivalently, 
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
f^2(x) + \\left[f'(x)\\right]^2 &= \\frac{k^2}{4}f^{4}(x)
\\end{align*}
Differentiating once more, setting $y = f(x),$ we get
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
2yy' + 2y'y'' &= k^2y^3y'
\\end{align*}
This gives us two possible cases
1. $y' = 0.$ In this case, $y$ is a constant $C$ for all $\\theta$ and the relation between arc length and sector area becomes
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
C\\int_a^x \\,d\\theta &= C^2\\frac{k}{2}\\int_a^x\\,d\\theta
\\end{align*}
And, assuming $C \\neq 0,$ we find that $f(\\theta) = C = 2/k.$

2. $y' \\neq 0.$ In this case, we can return to the first-order equation, setting $r = f(\\theta)$ to give us
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\right)^2 &= \\frac{k^2}{4}r^4 - r^2
\\\\
\\\\
&= r^2\\left(\\frac{k^2}{4}r^2 - 1\\right)
\\end{align*}
Taking the square root of both sides gives us the separable differential equation
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{dr}{d\\theta} &= r\\left(\\frac{k^2}{4}r^2 - 1\\right)^{1/2}
\\end{align*}
Separating the variables and setting up the integrals, we get
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\int \\frac{dr}{r\\sqrt{(k^2r^2/4) - 1}} &= \\int d\\theta
\\end{align*}
Now, recall from Section 6.22 Exercise 4 that
\\begin{align*}
D\\, \\text{arcsec}\\,x &= \\frac{1}{\|x\|\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}
\\end{align*}
This means that if $x = kr/2$ and $dx = kdr/2,$ the left-hand side becomes
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\int \\frac{dr}{r\\sqrt{(k^2r^2/4) - 1}} &= \\frac{2}{k}\\int \\frac{dx}{\\frac{2x}{k}\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\int \\frac{dx}{x\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\text{arcsec}\\,x + C
\\\\
\\\\
&= \\text{arcsec}\\left(\\frac{kr}{2}\\right) + C
\\end{align*}
Then, evaluating the right-hand side and rearranging terms, we see that
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\text{arcsec}\\,\\frac{kr}{2} &= \\theta + C
\\\\
\\\\
\\frac{kr}{2} &= \\sec\\left(\\theta + C\\right)
\\\\
\\\\
r &= \\left(\\frac{2}{k}\\right)\\sec\\left(\\theta + C \\right)
\\quad
\\blacksquare
