(b) What are the points at which the latus rectum intersect with the parabola? What is the derivative of the function at those two points?`,
                  solution: `(a) The parabola described by the Cartesian equation $y^2 = 4cx$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, thus the chord of length $8|c|$ drawn perpendicular to the $x$ axis can be described as two chords of length $4|c|$ drawn from the $x$-axis to the points $P = (4c, 4c)$ and $Q = (4c, -4c)$. Taking the dot product of these two points (that, is, vectors from $O$ to $P$ and $Q$, respectively), we get $0$. Thus, the two vectors are perpendicular. $\\blacksquare$

(b) First, we note that the Cartesian equation $y^2 = 4cx$ describes a parabola with focus $F = (c, 0)$ and vertex at $O$, thus putting the directrix line at $x = -c$, making the axis of the parabola the $x$ axis. 

Then, we find the points on the parabola where $x = c$, giving us $(c, 2c)$ and $(c, -2c)$. This means that the length of the latus rectum is $4c$. But we know that the distance from $(c, 0)$ to $(-c, 0)$ is $2c$, thus the latus rectum has length of twice the distance from the focus to the directrix. To find the slope of the lines tangent to the parabola at $(c, 2c)$ and $(c, -2c)$, we take the derivative with respect to $y$: $$\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{y^2}{4c}\\right) = \\frac{y}{2c}$$Evaluating this at $y=2c$ and $y=-2c$, we get slopes $1$ and $-1$, respectively, meaning that the line tangent to the parabola at $(c, 2c)$ has equation $x = y + b$. Evaluating the line at $(c, 2c),$ we find that $b$, the $x$-intercept, is $-c$, meaning that the line intercepts the $x$ axis through the directrix line. Doing this at $(c, -2c)$ gives a tangent line with equation $x = b - y$, evaluating at $(c, -2c)$ gives $b = -c$, meaning that this tangent line also intercepts the $x$ axis through the directrix line. This completes the proof.`,

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|} &= \\left(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2} \\\\

Where $T$ is the unit tangent $\\mathbf{v}/\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|$

Thus, we wish to show that the normal component of the acceleration vector is equal to  
$$
\\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}
$$
First, we recall that component-wise, acceleration is defined as
$$
\\mathbf{a}(t) = v'(t)T(t) + v(t)\\|T'(t)\\|N(t)
$$
where $N(t) = T'(t)/\\|T'(t)\\|$ is the principal normal vector.

The normal component of the acceleration vector (ie, the coefficient of the principal normal) is:
$$
\\begin{align*}
v\\|T'\\| &= v\\left\\Vert\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{v}\\right)'\\right\\Vert\\\\
&= v\\left\\Vert\\frac{\\mathbf{v}'}{v} - \\frac{v'}{v^2}\\mathbf{v}\\right\\Vert\\\\
&= \\|\\mathbf{a} - v'T\\|
\\end{align*}
$$
But we know by definition that $T$ and $N$ are perpendicular. If we take the dot product $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T,$ noting that $T$ has a length of 1, we get:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T &= v'(T \\cdot T) + v(N \\cdot T)\\\\
&= v'
\\end{align*}
$$
This means that we can rewrite $\\|\\mathbf{a} - v'T\\|$ as:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\|\\mathbf{a} - v'T\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a} - (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T) T\\|
\\end{align*}
$$
Now, we expand the right-hand side of the above equation, recalling that $T \\cdot T = 1,$ to give us:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\|\\mathbf{a} - (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T) T\\| &= \\left(\\left(\\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)T\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)T\\right)\\right)^{1/2} \\\\

&= \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} - \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot T\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}

Thus, we have proven that 

$$
v\\|T'\\| = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}

                  solution: `(a) If horizontal component of velocity is the negative of the vertical component of position, then the particle moves left when $y > 0$ and right when $y < 0$, making the motion counter-clockwise. 

(b) Taking the derivative of the ellipse equation with respect to $t$:

Substituting the component functions $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$, and recalling that $\\frac{dx}{dt} = -g(t)$, the above equation becomes:

\\mathbf{a}(t) = v'(t)T(t) + v(t)T'(t)

recalling that $T(t) = \\mathbf{v}(t)/v(t).$`,
                  solution: `(a) We know that the derivative of the cross product of two vectors $F,$ $G$ is:

But we know from Theorem 13.12 that the cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to those same two vectors, thus $A$ and $\\mathbf{a}(t)$ are orthogonal for all $t.$

(b) From part (a), we know that $\\mathbf{a}(t) = A \\times \\mathbf{r}'(t)$. Now, we write $\\mathbf{a}(t)$ as the linear combination of its components:

\\mathbf{a}(t) = r''(t)T(t) + r'(t)T'(t)

Using the result of part (a), we know that $\\mathbf{a}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) = 0.$ Applying this to the above equation for acceleration, we get:

But we know that the unit tangent $T(t) = \\mathbf{r}'(t)/\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$, and that $T'(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) = 0$ since the principal normal is orthogonal to any scalar multiple of the unit tangent vector. As such, the above dot product simplifies to:

$$
r''(t)r'(t) = 0
$$
for all $t$. Then, two possible cases arise.

(1) $r'(t) = 0$ for all $t$, in which case position is constant, with $A$ and $B$ being linearly dependent.
(2) $r'(t) \\neq 0 $ for all $t$, in which case $r''(t) = 0$, implying that speed is constant for all $t,$ with

(a) Prove that at each point of $C$ we have $T_Y(t) = T_X[u(t)]$ if $u$ is strictly increasing, but that $T_Y(t) = -T_X[u(t)]$ if $u$ is strictly decreasing. In the first case, $u$ is said to preserve orientation; in the second case, $u$ is said to reverse orientation.

(b) Prove that the corresponding principal normal vectors $N_X$ and $N_Y$ satisfy $N_Y(t) = N_X[u(t)]$ at each point of $C$. Deduce that the osculating plane is invariant under a change of parameter.`,

so it follows that if $u$ is strictly increasing, then $u'(t)/\|u'(t)\| = 1$ and $T_Y(t) = T_X[u(t)]$ and if $u$ is strictly decreasing, then $u'(t)/\|u'(t)\| = -1$ and $T_Y(t) = -T_X[u(t)]$

(b) Taking the derivative of $T_X$ with respect to $u$, we get:

$$
\\frac{d}{du}T_X(u) = T'_X(u)
$$
and the principal normal $N_X$ is
$$
N_X = \\frac{T'_X(u)}{\\|T'_X(u)\\|}

Taking the derivative of $T_Y$ with respect to $t$, we get:

$$
\\frac{d}{dt} T_Y = u'(t)\\frac{u'(t)}{\|u'(t)\|}T'_X[u(t)]

This demonstrates that the osculating plane is invariant under a change of parameter because the linear span of $T_X$ and $N_X$ is the same as that of $T_Y$ and $N_Y.$ Moreover, the cross products $T_X \\times N_X$ and $T_Y \\times N_Y$ only differ (potentially) by sign.

$$x = a(\\theta - \\sin \\theta), \\quad y = a(1 - \\cos \\theta)$$
let us first consider the position of the point as the circle rotates in place. The circle has a radius of length $a$ centered at $(0, a).$ As the circle rotates clockwise, the angle $\\theta$ swept out by the radius can be described as the angle between $A = (0, -a)$ and $B = (-x, -a + y),$ whose cosine is defined as:
$$
\\cos\\theta = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\|\\|B\\|}
$$
But $A$ and $B$ are both points on the circle, so their norms are both $a$, giving us:

$$
\\cos\\theta = \\frac{a^2 - ay}{a^2}
$$
In other words, we can parameterize $y$ as a function of $\\theta:$

$$
y = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)
$$
To express $x$ as a function of $\\theta$, we note once again that $B$ is a point on the circle with radius $a$. Substituting the above equation for $y$, we get
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\|B\\|^2 &= a^2
\\\\
&= x^2 + \\left[-a + (a - a\\cos\\theta)\\right]^2
\\\\
&= x^2 + a^2\\cos^2\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
Which means that $x^2 = a^2(1 - \\cos^2\\theta) = \\sin^2\\theta$ or that $\|x\| = a\\sin\\theta.$ But we know from before that $B = (-x, y - a),$ which implies that $a\\sin\\theta = -x,$ hence

$$x = -a\\sin\\theta$$
Now, suppose the circle rolls along the positive $x$-axis. This simply means that the circle's horizontal position is displaced by $a\\theta$ units of length as it rotates $\\theta$ radians. Thus, our $x$-component is displaced by $a\\theta,$ which gives us the parametric equations for position:

$$x = a(\\theta - \\sin \\theta), \\quad y = a(1 - \\cos \\theta)$$
as requested. $\\blacksquare$


(b) To show that $dy/dx = \\cot(\\theta/2)$, we first take the derivative of our positional components with respect to $\\theta$:

$$
\\frac{dx}{d\\theta} = a(1 - \\cos\\theta), \\quad \\frac{dy}{d\\theta} = a\\sin\\theta
$$
Then, we use the double-angle identities for sine and cosine:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin\\theta = 2\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}
\\end{align*}
$$
giving us:
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\\\
\\frac{dx}{d\\theta} = 2a\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2}; \\quad \\frac{dy}{d\\theta} = 2a\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}
\\end{align*}
$$
Then, we see that
$$
\\begin{align*}
\\frac{dy}{dx} &= \\frac{2a\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}}{2a\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2}}
\\\\
&= \\cot\\frac{1}{2}\\theta
\\end{align*}
$$
(valid for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$)

Now, we note that $\\cot(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta) = \\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2})$, which means the tangent line is parallel to the unit vector $\\mathbf{u}$ defined by:

$$
\\mathbf{u} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\mathbf{i} +  \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\mathbf{j}

The angle $\\phi$ between $\\mathbf{u}$ and the $x$-axis satisfies:

$$
\\begin{align*}
\\cos\\phi = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{i}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\|\\mathbf{i}\\|}
=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)

where $0 \\leq \\phi \\leq \\pi$ 

But this implies that the line tangent to the cycloid at $(x, y)$ makes an angle of $(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2})$ with the $x$-axis. $\\blacksquare$
